# In the beginning, there was the Assembly

Note. Many of you must already realize that my mother language is not English. Please give me feedback if you find any stupid expression. You can send me via DISCUSSION menu in gitbook site and Issue menu in github site.


In the Beginning of the computer world, there is a Word. It's the Assembly language.  
It's so close to the machine that it's hard to call it a language.
But it's a weird language ans it's not simply binary code with 0 and 1.
The assembly exists since the beginning.
Since assembly language is very close to the machine language, it's possible to control computer behavior in very specific.
Therefore learning the assembly is rather close to learning the computer than programming.  
So learning the assembly is closer to learning computer itself rather than programming it.
Studying computer itself helps us to figure out how every programming language works on a computer.
And you can see the principles common to all programming languages.  
So I'm sure, you will be able to see programs as assembly code as just like Neo see the world as code.
It's really fun.  
You will meet the new world inside of the computer that is actuall composed by many layers.
But you can see the very deep aspect of the computer world.
Learning assembly is like visiting new world because it makes you have an ability to understand and handle the complicated computer.
I cannot say that you would be super programmer if you know the assembly.  
But the excitement I felt when I first knew the assembly led me to the another world, Linux kernel and computer architecture. 
But the moment of when I saw the inside of computer after learning assembly drived me to the Linux kernel and computer architecture.
I want more people to have the chance to see the other aspect of the computer world.

I want to be like _Morpheus who gave the Red Pill to Neo_ ;-\)
